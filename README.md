# Verject

> Verject is a place where you can design & develop and get instant feedback.

### Files
All project files are listed in the left sidebar. 
You can add new ones or drag files into the editor to upload them. Verject supports all sorts of filetypes from png to json and html.

### Projects
Every project is a new website accessible from everywhere on the internet instantly. 
You can create new ones by clicking the new button. 
Projects get a random name by default - you can change it in `settings`. 
When you edit something it will instantly change.

### The editor
The editor is the place where will spend most of the time in - so we spent most of the time making it perfect. 
It adapts to the filetype. It can also give you a preview of uploaded images.

## Future
We will keep working on verject until it's the perfect tool for dev's. 
Just tell us about bugs on twitter.
